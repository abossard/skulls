description: "Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the project issue tracker: no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed."
disable-model-invocation: true
---

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec. Do NOT interview the user; just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## Outcomes

The smallest complete numbered list of user-observable outcomes. Each outcome names the actor, the behavior they can observe, and the benefit. Combine overlapping outcomes and remove any item whose removal loses no required behavior. Do not turn implementation tasks into outcomes.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Verification Decisions

Map every outcome to the intended verification:

| Outcome | Seam | Method | Observable result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <outcome number and gist> | <public interface> | <test, command, browser run, or human judgment> | <what must be observed> |

Use each outcome exactly once. Tests verify external behavior at the agreed seams, not implementation details. Name relevant prior art from the codebase. Reserve human judgment for subjective decisions, and keep it distinct from behavioral verification. For UI outcomes, include the route and state to drive, the DOM behavior to assert, and the screenshot state to capture. Code review is not a verification method.

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
